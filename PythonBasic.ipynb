        "Q6 Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "# Reason Why Lists Are Mutable but Tuples Are Immutable:\n",
        "Lists: In Python, lists are mutable because they are designed for situations where you need a dynamic, changeable collection. This means you can add, remove, or modify elements after the list has been created. This flexibility makes lists very powerful for various applications where data is not fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable. This is by design to provide a way to create fixed collections of items that cannot be changed. The immutability of tuples ensures that the data remains constant throughout the program, making them reliable for use as dictionary keys or to store data that should not change.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, mutability of lists provides flexibility for dynamic data manipulation, while immutability of tuples ensures data integrity and reliability for fixed data sets.\n",

        "# Implicit Casting\n",
        "In implicit casting, Python automatically converts one data type to another without any explicit instruction from the programmer.

For example, if you add an integer to a float, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float before performing the addition.\n",
